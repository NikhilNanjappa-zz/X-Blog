              <h1>Call to Action (CTA) - User Experience</h1>

<p>In this blog, I am going to share my point-of-view for designing “Call to Action (CTA) button/banner”. Whether it is a website or an application we need a trigger for the user to click and fire the event. This may sound simple and yes it is, if we keep a few things in consideration while designing. I have been designing user-friendly websites and applications to persuade the user to take desired action. For e-commerce website, <strong>Call to Action button is the key element for conversion rate drastically</strong>. Even minor information shared on your website is important, but some are more important and they have to stand out from the rest of the interface, and this is where Call to Action comes to rescue.  It is not only websites and applications where the call to action button is required, but if you see in day-to-day life we use many things which have to be trigger to perform action like; elevator in our offices, operating coffee machine, ATM machine, road sign-age, TV remote, mobile phone etc. It would be very difficult for these products to get successful if the designers had not kept the usability in mind. I tell you how: Imagine you are in China, where English is not the native language, everything you see is like fancy design, which does not mean anything to you. It would have been good if friendly icons were used to make things easy. I would like to share another incident, which was told by my friend. A couple of years back at Montreal’s Metro trains, which has been in operation for more than 40 years, the elevator panel had two buttons red and black, red for emergency and black for calling elevator. But users don’t know which button to hit for calling elevator, it seems providing intuitive user interfaces was not considered important to the STM (Montreal Transit Corporation) till 2009 as per the survey. Later it was resolved using yellow arrow indicating to hit.</p>

<p>What are the trigger points for a website:- Newsletter Subscription, Register, Download, Contact Us, Search, Buying etc. What are the trigger points for an application:- Submit Button – To send request. Search Button – Look for something.</p>

<p><strong>Key factors that influence user to trigger Call to Action button/banner as per the human psychology.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Colors:-</strong> Colors is used effectively to indicate highlighting or selection. We need to pick the right color combination based on scientific studies for influencing user. If your target audiences are kids then best color selection would be pink for girls and blue for boys. These are the physiology colors, which fascinate them and evoke an urge to take action, which can be even playing video game independently without any guidance to take action. Use the right text color to strengthen the design and easy to read. For e.g.: On dark background image use contrast color so it is easy to read. Also, keep in mind your app is used by old people for whom dark color will easily grab attention. When more than 7-8 colors are used in the same display, performance is often slower than non-color displays, try to limit your colors used in your color scheme to 5-6. When highly saturated colors appear together the eye struggles to focus, so avoid that.</p>

<p><strong>Placement:-</strong> Good CTA are not hidden to users, user does not need to find it, but it should peep out and thus placement plays very important role. It should be placed at eye catching location. The best place would be left of the screen or at place which follow “F Patter Screening”. Try to put CTA button on more white space so that it easily grabs attention. Use enough white space around the CTA so that it is easily different to interpret.</p>

<p><strong>Shape and Size:-</strong> I would suggest odd shape in the interface like round; this will easily grab user attention. Round is much preferable. There is scientific reason behind the round shape. Our Fovea eye is even faster in recording round shape due to easy resemble of apple or ball, which are the first words learned by everyone in their childhood. While my training at Human Factors International (HFI) , we also learn Fitts&#39;s law which says the bigger the size, more influence it has, even the bigger font size influence.</p>

<p><strong>Affordance:-</strong> I would also suggest making CTA button affordance so that user understands it easily to trigger. Give some border, shadow and embossed effect, which bulge out of the screen and easy to influence user to take action.</p>

<p><strong>Message:-</strong> Using the right words for your call to action button is as important as giving life to picture. Use common terms which are easy to understand and easy to interpret. Label for the CTA can achieve 1000 points but an unclear message will lose the point.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics/Icons:-</strong> Don’t use color as the only visual clue for critical activities. Try to use icons, which are familiar to reduce ambiguity and learning time. Use of appropriate icon is like half work done to influence your user.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Attention:-</strong> Make it large and eye catching. Use regular shape and not irregular shape as they reduce your site reliability. Use Dark shade to highlight your CTA button/banner.</p>

<p>If we consider all these elements while creating call to action button/banner, I am sure we will influence user to take action and meet our business goals. I am sharing few sample of Call to Action banner’s which I created long back. </p>
