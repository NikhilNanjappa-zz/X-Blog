                    <h1>VodQA  Shots</h1>

<p>While most of my Saturdays sound similar to the title of this blog, but this Saturday when I was planning to attend a talk on QA, I was not sure how my weekend would turn up to be; and, to my delight it was awesome! Its like I got a hangover after attending <strong>Thoughtworks vodQA conference</strong> in Gurgaon on 23rd June, 2012.</p>

<p><img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/vod1-300x193.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>This cool interactive session started with an Ice Breaker, where every one was asked to leave their seats and form a circle, now each one had to take an adjective + Name (Rule:- adjective must start from the first alphabet of their name, but that&#39;s not all one also had to repeat all adjectives + names combination taken by the people standing before them in the circle).</p>

<p>Then we had an Introductory Speech by Nitin who emphasized on QAs thought process and suggested that QAs should think as <strong>Business Advisors</strong> (Hats Off to that thought!) while most of the people feel that QA are just party poppers and stuffs like that this man made lots of sense in his speech.. Infact he suggested that the management should not say that we have technical QAs to their prospective client rather they should mention that they have business advisors. Being a QA guy I really can see how QAs turning to business advisers can change the scenario, and I am preety sure the change will be for good.</p>

<p>Next, Sadique Ali and Ranjan Sakalley spoke on managing test suites, <strong>Test Suite maintenance</strong> is a non-trivial problem that can cause significant headaches if not tackled with discipline In this talk, Sadique and Ranjan will went over some of the ways in which they&#39;ve countered this problem. They demonstrated how taking a different approach to testing and using appropriate tools like Twist is able to keep our suite fit and nimble.  ‘Twist’ is the automation tool created by ‘ThoughtWorks’ based on ‘ Behavior Driven Development’. Twist tackles the biggest problems that prevent most companies from building an automated regression suite that can keep pace with their complex changing application.</p>

<p>Game Testing was the next talk, taken up by Ravichandran, he talked about shall we test the game or its functionality. Before this session started a sheet with a sudoku game and I was busy there so couldnot re collect much from this session.</p>

<p><img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/vod3-300x198.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The next session was on <strong>TaaS – Testing as a Service</strong> presented by Ritesh and Akash, the Idea here was that projects or products having multiple applications should not to standardise on a single framework that provides a common test automation solution across their all platforms. Rather just as development, decisions should be made at a project level, each application should be tested using the tools and technologies that are &quot;right&quot; for them. “TaaS - Test as a Service” is a product that allows you this level of project independence, so that you can do test automation the right way.</p>

<p>Then we went for a lunch break, and post lunch we were sorted into groups again in a very innovative way; a tray with chits was circulated throught the group of audiences and every one was asked to pick up a chit which had the names of 4 different animals. Now once the chit was distributed amongst all the audiences everyone was asked to look in to their chits, find the animals name and make sounds of the corresponding animal listed on the chit and now everyone had to find people making similar noise and form a group, as I was a dog I waited for others to bark and then joined them. ;-)</p>

<p>Later each group was given a task first in the traditional way and then the Agile way. The idea was to understand the <strong>benefits of Agile</strong>, and the activity was very well managed and by the end of this activity the benefits of Agile were pretty clear to all.</p>

<p><img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/vod2-300x169.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then came Gaurav Bansal, to present a session on <strong><a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/2012/05/30/geb-groovy-browser-automation-tool-part-1/">Comprehensive Browser Automation</a></strong> Solution using Groovy, WebDriver and Object Model. Gaurav introduced an open-source testing solution that can be used for scripting, scraping and general automation – or equally as a functional/web/acceptance testing solution, and can be integrated with testing frameworks such as Spock, JUnit &amp; TestNG. In this session the audience also learnt how to design, create, maintain, and re-factor an <a href="http://xebee.xebia.in/2012/03/30/web-gui-automation-tools-strategies-patterns/">automation framework</a> using the power of WebDriver, the elegance of jQuery content selection, the robustness of Page Object modeling, and the expressiveness of the Groovy language. A very useful session and I am working to get <strong>GEB</strong> in my current project as we are already using selenium and Jbehave.</p>

<p>Batman (Sri Prasanna) paired with Prakriti Singh to speak on &#39;<strong>Testing as a hacker&#39;</strong>, well this was one of the most interesting session, where every one surrounded the Batman and PrakritiThe workshop covered several aspects of application security, demonstrated on real life web applications. The topics include XSS (not the usual alert(document.cookie)), CSRF, SQL injection, E4X (ticking time bomb), JSON hijacking, attacks based on HTML5 and a few other tricks.</p>

<p>So it was a Saturday well spent, the event was wonderful with a round of good and interactive sessions, also got to network a bit with the QAs who attendeded the event. Thanks ThoughtWorks for this QA platform. Looking forward for more such sessions and seminars... till then &#39;<em>happy automating&#39;</em>.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p><strong><a href="#9187" title="2012-07-19 22:35:43">Gaurav</a>:</strong> Very well written. Thanks for sharing gist of every session from the conference.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#9198" title="2012-07-20 08:19:09">Dheeraj</a>:</strong> Although whole event was awesome, but I liked the batman &#39;s session with so much humor and curiosity added. Everyone was amazed about how websites can be hacked.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#9200" title="2012-07-20 11:39:46">Ashutosh kumar</a>:</strong> Nicely written , But i am expecting next time whenever i read any VODAQA conference, there should be one more name with NItin , Sadique Ali, Ranjan Sakalley , Ritesh,Akash i.e Utsav SInha . Thanks for sharing</p>
