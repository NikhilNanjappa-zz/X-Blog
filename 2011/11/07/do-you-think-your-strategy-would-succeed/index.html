                    <h1>Do You Think Your Strategy Would Succeed?</h1>

<p>Small organisations/start-ups face a problem of scaling. People will like to stick to a company which is growing and showing tremendous progress in numbers.</p>

<p>Organisations run by command and control have couple of people calling the shots. But agile organisations when it comes to growing, they want their teams to define the tasks of how to execute a particular strategy. Good, if you have a very mature(great leaders) team who can come up with such a plan. But in many cases the team may require somebody to define those tasks very well for them.</p>

<p>Here we will talk about few common things that block organisations from making strategic progress on their business and some actions to address them.  <strong>Walking the Talk:</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Smart Talking:</strong></em> Companies often talk about their strategies. Some people fall into the trap of believing, that providing brilliant insights about what is going on in the business is adding value. It isn&#39;t. Value comes from doing and showing results.</p>

<p><strong><em>10,000 feet goals:</em></strong> Very high level goals or I want to do this...are another form of talking. Definitely they are highly motivating, but they are vague too. This will not tell people what to do when they start the day!</p>

<p><em><strong>Measurable steps:</strong></em> Strategic progress is made in concrete steps by specific people. So these specific people should translate these goals to clear, comprehendable tasks/action steps that will ensure strategic progress.</p>

<p><strong>Weak alignment:</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Passive vs Active agreement:</em></strong> There is a big difference between verbal agreements(nodding heads) vs people being ready, willing and committed to make this dream come true!(Active agreement).</p>

<p><strong><em>Get the whole organisation engaged:</em></strong> An org level business strategy should be well communicated and whole organisation should be motivated, involved, engaged to help execute strategic change. <em>** **</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Deal with Sabotage:</strong></em> Many times you will find people who will sabotage strategic progress because they disagree or they are personally threatened by change. Putting strategic things to action requires lot of effort with no immediate results. So tactical teams find it tough to accept this. Strategic goals and its tasks should be in the hands of highly motivated people, so that you know they would give their best and honest attempt. On the contrary, lesser motivated people prefer to pick up tactical work to show they are still contributing to the organisation as it shows some visible changes quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of progress tracking and accountability:</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Deadlines are respected:</em></strong> Deadlines come and go and nothing happens. Does your organisation let this happen? You need to measure, track and follow-up on low level tasks. You have to treat this as any other delivery/client project with specific milestones.</p>

<p>Agile organisation can do strategic stand-ups to measure and re-align tasks whenever required. If a deadline is missed then it&#39;s time to have a conversation(retrospective).</p>

<p><strong><em>Are you serious?:</em></strong> If you don&#39;t put sufficient time and effort in right direction to bring this change, then there is always reasons and temptations to go back to old way of doing things. This is not strategic failure, but execution failure. <strong>_ _</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Communicate/Connect:</em></strong> You need to communicate/connect with your people frequently to show them that you are dead serious about these strategic goals and by NOT making tactical decisions that undermine strategic progress.</p>

<p>Many organisations are too busy doing tactical things, invest too much effort on immediate needs. Hence they struggle or fail to make fast progress on strategic initiatives. So you need to constantly re-align, remind yourself or measure ROI of current effort.</p>

<p><strong><em>You have to strike a fine balance between tactical vs strategic things. You can&#39;t get to $100M business if you are too busy being a $10M business.</em></strong></p>

<p>You have to give <strong>sufficient time and people should have sufficient patience</strong> to see results on strategic initiatives.</p>

<p>You have to define a a <strong>timeline for yourself</strong> to measure and to conclude if you have failed or succeeded in your mission!</p>
