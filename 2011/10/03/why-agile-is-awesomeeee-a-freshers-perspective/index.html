              <h1>Why Agile is Awesomeeee..!!?? A Fresher&#39;s Perspective</h1>

<p><strong>Requirements -&gt; Design -&gt; Implementation -&gt; Integration -&gt; Testing -&gt; Maintenance</strong> , I have been forced to learn this for years. Even though I always thought how can some one design an application so big in one single go. But the educational structure that prevails in India don&#39;t let you think differently. Lets not change the subject here and instead of talking about India&#39;s educational structure lets talk more about the awesomeness of <strong>Agile</strong>.</p>

<p>Before joining an <strong>Agile</strong> firm like &quot;<strong><a href="http://xebia.in" title="Xebia India">Xebia</a></strong>&quot; I was into a mindset that &quot;Architectural or any design level task is supposed to be performed by technology heads or team leads and we are the mere workers who will simply code the designed architecture&quot;. Well the next line may seem a bit over-exagerated. But literally the previously stated thought of mine was broken into pieces when on the second day after joining the project(as a fresher) I was asked to discuss with team the design of the upcoming module.&quot; Thats the beauty of Agile it makes you feel that you are not a fresher but a &quot;<strong>team member</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>I always thought after joining as a fresher &quot;a Team lead/Project Manager or someone superior to me will be assigning me tasks and I will be completing those tasks without questioning them before the so-called deadline&quot;. Again I was bowled at my second pre-planning and planning meeting as I was asked, &quot;Vijay which stories do you think you can pick in this sprint&quot;. It was something that I never expected I literally asked, aren&#39;t you guys supposed to tell me what to do. That day I learned, in *<em>Agile *</em>environment you yourself estimate your work and pick your work on your own. Well that may seem a bit scary initially but on the flip side it makes you more responsible and confident.</p>

<p>One of the toughest thing when you join a project in between and that too as a fresher, is surely, getting along with the code base but <strong>Agile</strong> have a solution for every damn thing. Pair-programming in action. You pair-program with fellow programmers and you get to know every little thing about the codebase. One day you are with 0% knowledge of the technology stack and with in a week the knowledge rise to easily around 60%.</p>

<p>The best thing about pair programming is when you pair-program with your team members the team dynamics and communication increase. In a day you turn from a stranger to co-worker and with in a week a &quot;<strong>team member</strong>&quot;. So Agile comes out victorious again.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p><strong><a href="#5982" title="2011-10-04 18:45:48">Vijay Rawat</a>:</strong> Yes, I was actively involved in designing modules. :)</p>

<p><strong><a href="#6273" title="2011-11-28 15:59:59">PM Hut</a>:</strong> @Paritosh, What is XKE? I don&#39;t see where Vijay mentioned it in his post above...</p>

<p><strong><a href="#5980" title="2011-10-04 13:36:19">Enthusiastic</a>:</strong> There is huge difference in Designing and be with the team who is involved in design. Were you involved in designing? What level of design artifacts were developed by you? Did somebody review your design? Did you take a design sign-off? These are few questions came to my mind when you shared your thoughts about designing in agile...</p>

<p><strong><a href="#5978" title="2011-10-03 21:59:44">Vijay Rawat</a>:</strong> Hi Paritosh, Thanks for the information. I always thought XKE is a part of Agile. I have updated the post correspondingly.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#6276" title="2011-11-28 20:14:58">Vijay Rawat</a>:</strong> Hi PM Hut, I earlier mentioned about XKE practice in my blog. But I later learned that XKE is not part of Agile so I removed that part of my blog. FYI : XKE is a knowledge sharing practice followed at Xebia, in which, Xebians share( give a presentation/ open discussions, etc) their knowledge with fellow Xebians ever alternate Wednesday.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#5976" title="2011-10-03 20:00:27">Karan Gujral</a>:</strong> Being a fresher I could actually relate to the topic..! Another good read.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#5977" title="2011-10-03 20:54:49">Paritosh Ranjan</a>:</strong> Hi Vijay, XKE is not a part of Agile. And, most of the guys reading this post would have never heard of XKE. So, I think you need to update that part of blog. And regarding the &quot;being paid&quot; part. I would say that &quot;being paid&quot; is good. However, if you will do things only for &quot;being paid&quot; then you won&#39;t be able to do much. And, if you will do anything for &quot;being paid&quot;, then you will end up doing shitty things. So, being paid should not be that much awesome. Would you like to update this part also? First part of your blog is good. Now it should be your responsbility to treat the fresher, who, later in your career, might work with you in the same way in which you are being treated. And I am sure you will do that. Overall, nice read. Paritosh</p>
