				<h1>Do We Really Need An Agile Coach?</h1>

<p><strong>Coach</strong> – To help someone achieve their goals. To help them achieve it with efficiency, even perfection, to listen to people, to TALK to them! To see their excitement, suspicion, energy… Doesn’t that trigger a nerve of passion?  I had the wonderful opportunity to have one of our Agile Coaches, Guido Schoonheim, fly down to India and have a word with me regarding what it takes to be an Agile coach along with the challenges and excitement thereof. Thanks to the post I was handling at North India’s first “AgileNCR” seminar (chief of Coordination Committee), it gave me a golden opportunity to interact with our guest of honor - <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/profiles/49-pete-deemer">Pete Deemer</a>, ex-Yahoo VP, one of the few Certified Scrum Trainers and listen to his experiences during his sessions on Agile. I was really getting excited about the prospective of being an Agile Coach, when I realized it was possible within my current organization.</p>

<p>But right then I came across a very interesting blog post that put the question flat on my face – “Do we really need an Agile Coach?” It led me to ponder over the question. I tried to dig deeper. Here I present a conglomeration of what I learned through various sites, posts and interacting with people like Guido and Pete Deemer. My personal experience with Agile Coaching is however limited to the above sources of information and I am yet looking forward to get down and get my hands dirty with it.</p>

<p>The discussion in the article has been arranged into the following heads:</p>

<ul>
<li>What&#39;s an Agile Coach after all? What specific capabilities are he expected to posses?</li>
<li>How is he different from traditional project management?</li>
<li>Do we really need an Agile Coach?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So what&#39;s an Agile Coach?</strong> As the name would suggest, An Agile Coach is someone who “coaches” <em>a team</em> to work with Agile Development Methodologies. Note however that there is a subtle yet important difference between “coaching” and “training” – A trainer visits you for a short period, walk you through the process of Agile and moves on. An Agile Coach, on the other hand, is expected to stay with the team longer, let them adapt agile, and move on only when the team is comfortable enough to carry it forward on its own.</p>

<p>(In <a href="http://www.swqual.com/newsletter/vol5/no3/vol5no3.html">one of Steve&#39;s blogs</a>, he discusses an interesting differentiation between Agile with a capital “A” and agile with a small “a”. In this blog however, I always intend to refer to “Agile Development Methodology” irrespective of which case I use to write “Agile”).</p>

<p><strong>What specific capabilities are expected out of an Agile Coach?</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.agileadvice.com/archives/2005/10/agile_coachment.html">Mishkin Berteig</a>, an agile coach or mentor should have some really specific experience and capabilities. These are:</p>

<p><strong>Experience:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Working in strictly timeboxed iterations with adaptive planning using some sort of prioritized work list</li>
<li>Working in a &quot;test-driven&quot; manner (e.g. writing a document for a client where the client specifies acceptance criteria)</li>
<li>Participating in frequent status meetings where the team members report to each other, commit to work and identify barriers</li>
<li>Building and maintaining big visible charts to show progress and status (e.g. the standard thermometer chart to show progress towards a numerical goal)</li>
<li>Fashioning appropriate tracking and performance metrics that encourage team work rather than individual competition</li>
<li>Helping other people to adopt and adapt all these practices</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Capabilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Promoting collaboration in challenging circumstances</li>
<li>Searching for truth/a solution relentlessly</li>
<li>Honesty and trustworthiness</li>
<li>A learning attitude (proactive and learning from mistakes)</li>
<li>Humility and assertiveness</li>
<li>Guiding people without controlling them</li>
<li>Detachment (ability to step out of a situation)</li>
<li>An attitude of service without expecting recompense</li>
<li>Understanding of transformative learning</li>
<li>Conflict resolution as learning (not negotiation)</li>
<li>Encouraging creativity</li>
<li>A sense of humor and the ability to create positive energy. Very important for teams going through sometimes difficult change - as suggested by Pete Deemer as a feedback to this blog.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not Required:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Technical experience related to the work of the team.</li>
<li>Domain experience related to the goal of the work - the Agile Coach should not be a direct stakeholder in the results of the work. However, technical experience and domain experience can sometimes help.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How is he different from traditional project management?</strong></p>

<p>As per <a href="http://www.danube.com/blog/kanemar/a_career_model_for_agile_coaches.html">KaneMar</a>, the attributes that are appropriate for an Agile coach are quite different than those for traditional project management. For example, rather than being able to track individuals and tasks, the Agile coach needs to know how to motivate the team into forming a self organizing group. He suggests:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What previously worked in an environment modeled on Taylorism, is no longer appropriate in an environment that is continually changing. Agile projects require different skills and these should be recognized and rewarded differently. Specifically, a Taylorist view of the world rewards greater specialization of skills. This can be clearly seen with methodologies such as RUP which categorize people into specific roles such as Analysts, Developers, Architects etc. In contrast an Agile enviornment favours individuals who work together as a team. It favours group decision making and, by implication, those individuals who have the ability to facilitate and abide by the group decision. Agile projects are at a disadvantage with someone who does not directly contribute to the overall success of the project in some way. In an Agile model, the project manager that only wants to update the project plan and report to manager senior management is overhead for the team. Similarly, the architect that never wants to mentor staff but only wants to draw UML diagrams and dictate a solution to the team is detrimental to overall progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Do We Really Need An Agile Coach?</strong></p>

<p>All said and done, teams who really practice Agile methodologies, know that its really simple and natural to follow that route to software development. Once the initial resistance has been overcome, it is quick to get into the DNA of a software developer. They sometimes ask – Big Deal? Isn’t that the most natural and simple way to go? Why on earth would something so simple need to be coached? I came across <a href="http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2006/08/agile-coach-agile-secret-police.html">one such blog</a> by Paul Tyma who compared an Agile Coach to an Agile Secret Police! What followed was a very interesting chain of replies …</p>

<p>He criticizes the whole concept of Agile Coach saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I especially don&#39;t get this new craze of a job of &quot;Agile Coach&quot;. I mean, everything I&#39;ve read about Agile and XP seems dead simple. I&#39;m still confused why I need a &quot;coach&quot; for Agile. I&#39;d WAY rather have a coach for Java Generics, type theory, or God-help me, C++ templates. That stuff is definitely harder. Comparatively, agile seems a no-brainer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He further adds...</p>
