              <h1>Application of IT in Rural Development</h1>

<p><strong>Jaipur, Aug 23, Saturday, 11:45 AM:</strong> My phone played my favorite ring tune from an old Movie... &quot;Hello Abhishek, this is Dr. Gupta, head of Computer Science Department, RKG Institute of Technology. We met a few months back when you were a speaker at The Agile Workshop at our institute. Do you remember?&quot; ... My mind flashed back a couple of months, where I, along with Anurag and Elco were waiting for the already too off the track workshop to catch up on time and we finally get our slots to speak. I quickly scanned the panel of &quot;elite&quot; people adorning the stage, most of them with an experience in their fields that&#39;s worth more than my total age. I tried to recall who among them was Prof Gupta - was it the bald headed man in his late 40s who was really optimistic about life and future, or was he the man with all grey hairs in his early sixties, who despite being an expert in his own field was upfront about having no idea what was this &quot;Agile&quot; thing and was enthusiastic to see what it was all about...</p>

<p>&quot;Oh of coarse Dr Gupta, how can I forget you and your ever inspiring youthful energy and charm. Very Good Morning Sir, how have you been?&quot; I was positive I had the right picture in mind. &quot;Hey I am great, thank you Abhishek. You will be happy to know that we are organizing yet another IT conference on National Technology Day. I would appreciate if you can share your knowledge with my students.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For sure Dr Gupta, I would love to share whatever I know, when is the conference scheduled?&quot; &quot;August 30 - Next Saturday&quot;</p>

<p>Next Saturday - another Agile conference. That&#39;s exciting. Its been 2 months I last got involved in such things. I remember my senior advising me, when I joined my current project - &quot;2 months Abhishek. That&#39;s all we have to deliver, and this is a completely new technology stack. I would advise you to concentrate all energies on this, and don&#39;t organize further conferences for 2 months. Of coarse, that&#39;s just my view and advise&quot;. One of the good things at Xebia, here people advise and don&#39;t force anything down your throat. Its been 2 months since that advice came to me, we are at the other end of this project, and we have delivered reasonably good. What a timing of Dr Gupta&#39;s call...</p>

<p>Having attended so many of them and spoken at a few already, I know what to present. I know he will next ask me if I can tell him the topic I would be speaking on. Well I can pick Agile, Scrum or XP, or better still - my favorite planning game...</p>

<p>&quot;Its on <strong>Applying IT to Rural Development</strong>&quot;... &quot;Sorry Dr Gupta , its regarding applying IT to what?&quot;... I was jolted back to reality that people still want to listen about things other than Agile. Non Agile, non JAVA conferences still happen. And more surprisingly, people believe I can &quot;share my knowldge&quot; in one of them!</p>

<p>I tried to quickly recall all my projects in past 5 years, and see if any of them actually helped the rural development - railways, airlines, online shopping, supply chain, mobile photo logging, VoIP and SBC... none! The project for Department of Defense? Not exactly. Of coarse if someone bomb us, it will affect rural people as much as urban, but will it count as applying IT to rural development? So I have done nothing to apply IT for rural development! And I have already given my word to Dr. Gupta.</p>

<p>It was pointless to think about all this, now that I had agreed and the phone was hung up. The fact remained that I was on a holiday at Jaipur, will be back on Sunday night, will have 5 working days (which means just the evenings) to see if I can come up with something worth sharing....</p>

<p><strong>Monday, August 25 evening:</strong> I did what we are best at - Google for the topic. I was pleasantly surprised to see research papers and many other nice documents on this topic. A guy doing his research on the same from the University of California was kind enough to publish his learnings in a white paper giving me enough material to first convince myself as the first step. So there I was - sitting in front of my soul mate - whom people lovingly call &#39;Dell Vostro 1000&quot; - trying not to let Dr Gupta down.</p>

<p>As is natural, at first I met with all the reasons why IT can NOT be possibly applied for development of Rural India:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Some Real Problems standing in face of applying IT to Rural Development</strong> High rate of illiteracy Even those who are literate don’t know English – the primary language for computer applications How many people can actually afford a PC? Urban Bias - software being written by people in big cities who are far removed from root realities Computers only provide information, they don’t solve the problem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so do we still have any hope? Let&#39;s see all the potential areas (even if theoretical) where we can atleast think of applying IT for rural development. There were many:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Potential Areas of Application</strong> <strong>Health Services</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Local doctors can access latest information about health schemes and seek advise from specialists. Medical databases enable them to make better diagnosis</li>
<li>Access to more qualified doctors through streamed audio, interactive web sites and video conferences </li>
<li><p>Skill up gradation courses could be organized where doctors could upgrade their skills through lecture sessions, video films and video conferences conducted on line
<strong>Development of Education</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Replacing costly books, that never reach the students, with e-Books</p></li>
<li><p>Up gradation of Skills for teachers</p></li>
<li><p>Video-casting sessions from bigger schools</p></li>
<li><p>Online libraries open up a realm of possibilities
<strong>Development of e-Commerce</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Fishermen and farmers can get information on weather.</p></li>
<li><p>Information on market prices before fishermen return to shore.</p></li>
<li><p>On-phone transactions, specially for villages having no near by branch.
<strong>E-Governance</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Sea change in degree of transparency</p></li>
<li><p>Ready availability of information on examination results, Passport status, PAN Card application …</p></li>
<li><p>On-line Income Tax returns
<strong>Agriculture</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Better rate for the yield due to awareness of market rates</p></li>
<li><p>Tips on crops, diseases, weather</p></li>
<li><p>Ideas and instructions on resource-use like manure, rain water harvesting, bio-gas plant</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Then do we have any practical solutions to the practical sounding problems we cited above?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Practical Solutions to the Practical Problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>PC may not be personal computer – but a community machine.</li>
<li>Dropping rates of hardware – OLPC - One Laptop Per Child ( They aim at $100 laptops).</li>
<li>State WAN.</li>
<li>Even if it is a mere information tool, its a great facilitator. Villagers have their own information needs.</li>
<li>Availability of computers that can run on low power</li>
<li>To tackle urban bias, develop localize content in local languages. This also provides employment opportunities</li>
<li>Already in some states all official forms can be accessed on the net, village maps and land records are available in many cases and job opportunities for the youth can be found. And lot of this content is available in local languages.</li>
<li>School books are not available, replicating them comes at a cost, replicating eBooks is the way to go</li>
<li><strong>Video-on-demand services</strong>. Repetition of classes for different batches with little cost is possible</li>
<li>Standardization of quality of teacher and materials and more effective pedagogy through better design of visuals can be achieved</li>
<li>School teachers can use educational CD’s to improve and update the science/arithmetic knowledge</li>
</ul>
