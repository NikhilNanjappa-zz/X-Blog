				<h1>Team Dynamics - what to expect and do?</h1>

<p>Effective teamwork is essential in today’s world, but as you’ll know from the teams you have led or belonged to, you can’t expect a new team to perform exceptionally from the very outset. Team formation takes time, and usually follows some easily recognizable stages, as the team journeys from being a group of strangers to becoming united team with a common goal.</p>

<p>As part of my curriculum of “<em>Leadership Training for Software Professionals</em>” at IIM, Bangalore, I came across some very interesting and highly applicable models explaining various stages of team dynamics. It also laid out what we, as managers, should do/expect at various stages of the team maturity.  <strong>Tuckman’s forming-storming-norming-performing model</strong> Psychologist Bruce Tuckman first came up with the memorable words “<strong>forming, storming, norming and performing</strong>” back in 1965 to describe the path to high-performance that most teams follow. Tuckman&#39;s model explains that as the team develops maturity and ability, relationships establish, and the leader changes leadership style. Beginning with a directing style, moving through coaching, then participating, finishing delegating and almost detached. At this point the team may produce a successor leader and the previous leader can move on to develop a new team.</p>

<p><img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/forming4.jpg" alt="Tuckman Model" title="tuckmanModel"></p>

<p>Teams initially go through a &quot;<strong>Forming</strong>&quot; stage in which members are positive and polite. Some members are anxious, as they haven’t yet worked out exactly what work the team will involve. Others are simply excited about the task ahead. As leader, you play a dominant role at this stage: other members’ roles and responsibilities are less clear.</p>

<p>This stage is usually fairly short, and may only last for a single meeting at which people are introduced to one-another. At this stage there may be discussions about how the team will work, which can be frustrating for some members who simply want to get on with the team task.</p>

<p>Soon, reality sets in and your team moves into a &quot;<strong>Storming</strong>&quot; phase. The honeymoon is over. The silent leaders may be clashing for control of the group. Your authority may be challenged as others jockey for position as their roles are clarified. The ways of working start to be defined, and as leader you must be aware that some members may feel overwhelmed by how much there is to do, or uncomfortable with the approach being used. Some react by questioning how worthwhile the goal of the team is and resist taking on tasks. This is the stage when many teams fail and even those who stick with it feel that they are on an emotional roller coaster as they try to focus on the job in hand without the support of established processes or relationships with their colleagues.</p>

<p>Gradually, the team moves into a &quot;<strong>Norming</strong>&quot; stage, as roles are established. Team members come to respect one&#39;s authority as leader, and others show leadership in specific areas.</p>

<p>Now the team members know each other better, they may be socializing together, and they are able to ask each other for help and provide constructive criticism. The team is developing a strong commitment to the team goal, and you start to see good progress towards it.</p>

<p><em>There is often a prolonged overlap between storming and norming behavior</em>: As new tasks come up, the team may lapse back into typical storming stage behavior, but this eventually dies out.</p>

<p>When the team reaches the &quot;<strong>Performing</strong>&quot; stage, hard work leads directly to progress towards the shared vision of their goal, supported by the structures and processes which have been set up. Individual team members may join or leave the team without affecting the performing culture.</p>

<p>As leader, you are able to _delegate _much of the work and can concentrate on developing team members. Being part of the team at this stage feels “easy” compared with earlier on.</p>

<p>Bruce Tuckman refined his theory around 1975 and added a fifth stage to the Forming Storming Norming Performing model - he called it <strong>Adjourning</strong>, which is also referred to as Deforming and Mourning – they rhyme better! Adjourning is arguably more of an adjunct to the original four stage model rather than an extension - it views the group from a perspective beyond the purpose of the first four stages. The Adjourning phase is certainly very relevant to the people in the group and their well-being, but not to the main task of managing and developing a team, which is clearly central to the original four stages.</p>

<p>Project teams exist only for a fixed period, and even permanent teams may be disbanded through organizational restructuring. As team leader, your concern is both for the team’s goal and the team members. Breaking up a team can be stressful for all concerned and the &quot;Adjourning&quot; or &quot;Mourning&quot; stage is important in reaching both team goal and personal conclusions.</p>

<p>The break up of the team can be particularly hard for members who like routine or have developed close working relationships with other team members, particularly if their future roles or even jobs look uncertain.   </p>

<p><strong>Hersey and Blanchard&#39;s Situational Leadership® model</strong> <img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/sitlead11.jpg" alt="Situational leadership" title="situationalLeadership"> *<em>The classic Situational Leadership® model *</em>of management and leadership style also illustrates the ideal development of a team from immaturity (stage 1) through to maturity (stage 4) during which management and leadership style progressively develops from relatively detached task-directing (1), through the more managerially-involved stages of explanation (2) and participation (3), to the final stage of relatively detached delegation (4), at which time ideally the team is largely self-managing, and hopefully contains at least one potential management/leadership successor. The aim of the leader or manager is therefore to develop the team through the four stages, and then to move on to another role. Ironically this outcome is feared by many managers. However, good organisations place an extremely high value on leaders and managers who can achieve this. The model also illustrates four main leadership and management styles, which a good leader is able to switch between, depending on the situation (ie., the team&#39;s maturity relating to a particular task, project or challenge.)   </p>

<p><strong>Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum</strong></p>

<p>The Tannenbaum and Schmidt Continuum also correlates in a way to the models above - essentially that management style tends to offer more freedom as the group matures.</p>

<p>As the team matures and becomes more self-sufficient and self-directing, so the manager&#39;s style should react accordingly, ideally becoming more detached, more delegating, encouraging and enabling the group to run itself, and for a successor (or if you are a good manager or a lucky one, for more than one successor) to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>So what&#39;s the way ahead ?</strong> As a team leader, your aim is to help your team reach and sustain high performance as soon as possible. To do this, you will need to change your approach at each stage. The steps below will help ensure you are doing the right thing at the right time.</p>
