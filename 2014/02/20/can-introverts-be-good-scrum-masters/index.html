                    <h1>Can introverts be good scrum masters?</h1>

<p>It’s mostly and very commonly considered that introverts are not leadership material. And definitely not ideal scrum masters.</p>

<p>The way you can spot an introvert is by looking for people who are:</p>

<p>•Seeking solitude •Thinking first, talking later •Focusing on depth •Preference to write than talk •Exhibiting calmness</p>

<p><strong>How to ensure introverts become good scrum masters?</strong></p>

<p>While introverts can be those who are not very comfortable talking; they can also bring in another aspect within the team- listening. Since the role of a Scrum Master is about facilitating than shouting orders, most introverts will be more comfortable doing it. Because they are thinkers, they come up with out of the box solutions for the team and can understand what and how decisions or things impacts the team. They are a great force in bringing the team together along with resolving inter-team conflicts very strategically. Since they don’t want attention to themselves, they are great facilitators who can get things done without shouting at their top of their lungs. In fact they are amazing scrum masters when most of the team members are extroverts; they are the only one who can manage the rowdy loud team members. They bring in a lot of thought and calmness in the team when things go out of control, they are great one to one conversationalist and can create the rapport with time.</p>

<p>They are the change agents who work behind the scene and should always be considered as the key influencers for the team. In most cases team members listen to these people because of their thinking hat persona. Also just because they are introverts, doesn’t mean they mince words. They are strong leaders who can take the stand when required.</p>

<p>Whether introverts are encouraged or not as key team players or part of teams depends completely on the organizational environment. <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6494.html">&quot;By fostering a work environment where people feel free to speak up and be proactive, the organization is creating the right place for introverted leaders to be successful.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Most introverts are also very stubborn, once they put their minds in something it’s very difficult to change them and that’s why sometimes they are perceived them as being difficult to work with or seem unfriendly. In reality once they take up the role and have committed to it, they are the best scrum master a team can have.</p>

<p>While trying to bond with introverts, it might also help management or anyone to consider: •Not accuse them publicly- most introverts are sensitive, so one on one might help. Don’t accuse, just have a conversation. •Don’t push them when unnecessarily- they are patient but will snap if too much pressure is created on them. •Try understanding their point of view first- before saying yours blatantly, listen to their first. They will listen more of yours after that •Give them space- when in denial or with opinions that don’t match yours, give them the space for them to rethink it over.</p>
