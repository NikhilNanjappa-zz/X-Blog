				<h1>IndicThreads Conference on Software Quality, 2010</h1>

<p><strong>IndicThreads Conference on Software Quality, 2010</strong></p>

<p>The first <a href="http://q10.indicthreads.com/">IndicThreads Conference on Software Quality</a> was held on 5th and 6th March 2010 in Pune, India. I decided to attend and explore this event in order to interact and exchange thoughts with professionals from across the industry. The driving factors that pushed me to attend this event were the curiosity about latest happenings in QA world and the way different organizations are implementing QA practices. And yes, networking was a thought at the back of my mind too, though I wasn’t sure how this experience will turn out for me. I started my journey with lots of thoughts over how can I get the maximum benefit out of this opportunity in terms of knowledge and networking I landed in Pune.</p>

<p>@Pune, India</p>

<p>The first day, there were gathering of around 40 people. Delegates and speakers all were quite enthusiastic for the upcoming sessions and schedules. This two days conference touched upon various topics like Agile testing, penetration testing, Automation by Jmeter, test automation in flex, testing techniques for mobile applications.</p>

<p>In this blog, I would cover the gist of all the sessions:</p>

<p><strong>Day 1: 5</strong><strong>th</strong>** March, 2010**</p>

<p>Agile was discussed in almost in every session. Every tool or technology discussed in terms of adaptability to Agile environment. Sessions were mostly clinging around from ‘Agile testing – Principles and Practices’ to ‘Smarter Sprint Cycles, Better Deliverable’. Few people talked about Test Automation in Flex using flexmonkey tool by gorillalogic. There was one session, “Advanced Penetration Testing”, on security testing that I really found interesting. I will try to briefly sum up what I gained from this session. I get to know that penetration testing is all about assessment of security and security is one of the major aspect of quality. Another point this session laid emphasis on was, to be a good pen tester one must have focus on innovation as well tools. There are many tools available in the market these days, but these tools will only provide few matrix that may limit the effectiveness. A good pen tester should always try to mimic the attacker&#39;s behaviour and try to break the application. One should create the attacked scenarios on the basis of “Threat Modelling”: and Abuse cases” and then go ahead with testing. To conclude, this session discussed the steps that may assist in reasonable assessment of the security posture of an application.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2: 6</strong><strong>th</strong>** March, 2010**</p>

<p>Second day started with discussion on Web Test Automation Framework ‘Tekila’ by using open source tools powered by Google WebDriver. They claimed that TeKila is an aggregation of several Open Source powers – Google Web Driver, HTML Unit, Java Robots, TestNG &amp; many more. It offers a tool kit to test Web Application at different levels &amp; in modes. After this discussion another session takes place and that was about Performance and Automation Testing using Apache Jmeter for Agile Environment that follows with another session “Write Tests in End Users’ Lingo”. This session basically discussed the various benefits of writing tests in the end user’s language and the different ways in to achieve it. This discussion followed by a session on “Testing Techniques for Mobile Applications”. This was really an interesting session and forced me brief little more about it. Testing of mobile application will be as difficult as their development. There are a number of factors to consider for mobile testing which aren&#39;t present for desktop or web. . This session discussed various types of mobile applications (Browser-based, Preinstalled and Installable), multiple platforms like: iPhone, Andriod, BlackBerry, Symbian, Windows Mobile J2ME applications. This session ended with an overview of testing and debugging tools that are available in market and can be used specifically for mobile testing. Additionally, testing the application in simulator, using various debugging tools are some further adventures which the tester undergoes during testing cycles.</p>

<p>My personal take aways after two days of conference were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Security must be built “ground-up” in the application; It Cannot be “bolted-on” to the application.</p></li>
<li><p>Some top security tools for:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>o Web console - Burrp, Ratproxy, Web-scarab</p>

<p>o Network protocol- Wireshark, nmap, netcat</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overview of testing mobile application and mobile application in simulator, using various debugging tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Challenges that may come up during mobile testing life cycles.</p></li>
</ul>
