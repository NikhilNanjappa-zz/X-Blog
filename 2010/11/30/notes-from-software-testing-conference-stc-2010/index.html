              <h1>Notes from Software Testing Conference (STC 2010)</h1>

<p>Recently I attended <a href="http://www.qaiglobal.com/minisites/stc_2010/index.htm">STC 2010</a>, the 10th edition of the international Software testing conference organized by <a href="http://www.qaiglobal.com/QGS/Default.asp">QAI</a> in Bangalore on 22-23 Nov. This year the theme of the conference was Testing 3.0- From transaction to transformation. I was pretty excited to see the conference program as the speakers included a good mix of industry leaders, practitioners and testing experts slated to present on a wide array of interesting topics. This is a short experience report of the 2 day conference based on the sessions I managed to attend as well as relate to and my interaction with some of the speakers/participants.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p>Although still weary from late arrival at Bangalore, me and my colleague managed to reach the venue in time. As soon as we got ourselves registered we quickly glanced through the schedule and marked sessions of interest.The program on day 1 initially was all keynotes followed by 3 parallel tracks. The parallel tracks were split up based on categories such as Business leadership, Test program management and Techniques and Tools. Majority of the sessions I chose to attend were in the &#39;Tools and Techniques&#39; category. </p>

<p>The proceedings started with a session by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/india/msindia/msindia_executive_amit.aspx">Amit Chatterjee</a> from Microsoft. His presentation started with a futuristic video displaying the power of surface computing and smart devices (cool MS technology). He posed the obvious question to the audience as to how we are going to test such complex software. His talk was titled &#39; What does it take for professional testers to succeed in an Agile team?&#39; in which he talked about how agile has transformed the role of a tester from &#39;Critical&#39; to &#39;Creative and Collaborative&#39;. He also stressed on the fact that testers should focus on the flow of value and reduction of waste which is possible through greater collaboration. He reckoned that in order to succeed in agile environment we need ‘smart’ tools to reduce cycle time. Few tips he offered were lightweight planning, exploratory testing and minimizing set-up time by using techniques such virtualization. He also talked about test impact analysis which can allow execution of only impacted test cases while regression to make regression testing smarter and faster. Since the essence of what he spoke was mainly agile and related practices, I could relate to his presentation fairly easily as we at <a href="http://xebiaindia.com/in">Xebia</a> have been focusing on agile since very beginning. His talk suggested that agile practices are gaining a lot of traction within big companies like Microsoft which is a positive trend.</p>

<p>Next was a talk titled &#39;Modern Applications Demand-A sophisticated approach to Quality&#39; by Andrew Bearsley from HP. He stressed the need for &#39;Automation&#39; and &#39;Modernization&#39; in order to meet the current quality challenges. Automation, he said, has to be applied at task, process and service delivery level. By &#39;Modernization&#39; he meant to be fast, lean and innovative in order to achieve quality goals. He also introduced a new tool called &#39;HP Sprinter&#39; which sort of tries to address the lack of tooling in agile testing space from the HP stable. Finally he talked of few techniques around which the tool is built like exploratory testing, mirror testing, data injection, screen annotation and smart defect logging to accelerate the test execution process.</p>

<p>The final keynote session was from <a href="http://www.infosys.com/about/management-profiles/Pages/manish-tandon.aspx">Manish Tandon</a> from Infosys. He stressed on business process based approach to testing. His paper &#39;Transformation in Testing and Testing in Transformation&#39; highlighted the transformation in tester profile enabled by the current business dynamics and technology landscape. He rightly remarked that the testers lie at a unique intersection of domain and technology and possess lot of power which can enable positive change. Some of the key takeaways were that testers needs to transform and align with business, end to end approach to quality has to be adopted and building agility into test teams is the way forward.</p>

<p>Next were the parallel tracks from which I would like to mention a few I managed to attend and relate to. First one was &#39;Journey to next level of automation- A road less traveled&#39; by Ashish Guru-Capgemini. Ashish spoke about a number of frameworks that has been developed in-house and how those led to increase in test coverage and savings in terms of time, effort and cost. These reusable frameworks have some really nice features as they are tool agnostic, configurable to work with and without UI and can be plugged into any other framework. I felt the 20 minutes of time allotted to each speaker was too less to gain much as they scrambled to complete their presentation in the stipulated time. After the session I had a short discussion with Ashish on creating a reusable framework using open-source tools like Selenium by applying some of the concepts he talked about in his paper. Since time was at premium we agreed to discuss this later at some other forum. </p>

<p>The other presentation which I really liked was &#39;DIY:Cloud based low cost, Elastic load generation using open source tools&#39; where Nikhil from MindTree presented his experiences of creating a performance testing framework based on two of the most promising and upcoming trends in the Software industry: Open source tools and Cloud. I liked this since I too have been tinkering with this idea of creating a cloud based load testing capability using open source tools and it was good to hear someone sharing his practical experiences on the same. Nikhil and his team used <a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/">STAF </a>and some other open source tools for their framework and deployed it on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> to generate load. They also wrote some custom utilities for performance monitoring, error logging and reporting. In my opinion we have just seen the tip of the iceberg and these new platforms and technologies will shape the &#39;testing to come&#39;.</p>

<p>Another paper was from Arit from &#39;MindTree&#39; with an interesting and catchy title &#39;An elegant approach to automated software testing using the dimension of AI&#39;. I carried high expectations from the session but rather was left with some un-answered questions and a feeling of wanting more. Arit talked about creating an intelligent oracle for verifying automated tests using machine learning. It seemed to me a lot like creating an n-way combination of tests with some flavor of model based testing and Markov Models. Creating an intelligent oracle this way is very complex and as a tester you would fall in a trap spending a lot of effort verifying the oracle rather than the application itself. Although I must confess that it was a brave attempt by the speaker to try and experiment with something like this but I do feel there was lot of scope for further experimentation and backing-up the claims with some solid practical experiences. I wish Arit a very good luck in his research. </p>

<p>After a frantic schedule throughout the day, the evening provided the much needed respite and opportunity to unwind. The evening was very well planned with awards night punctuated with some entertaining performances by a local dance troupe and some really crazy antics by the organizers and the attendees. Everybody had a nice time with drinks, laughter and good food.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>Day 2 had keynote sessions till lunch followed by a couple of parallel tracks post lunch. Almost all the speakers presented papers related to trends in software quality and testing. Suresh Ramakrishnan from capegemini presented <a href="http://www.capgemini.com/insights-and-resources/by-publication/2010-11-world-quality-report/">World Quality Report</a> which contained some insightful revelations. Some of the important findings of the report were:</p>
