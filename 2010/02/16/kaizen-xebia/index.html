                    <h1>Kaizen &amp; Xebia</h1>

<p>My purpose of writing this blog is to quickly take people through the voyage of Xebia. This will probably be of more interest to new Xebians and for them who wish to know more about Xebia. The story starts with a flashback when I had joined Xebia in June 2008. At that time, the headcount was 20 and I was the 20th Xebian. I used to hear the growth story of Xebia from my colleagues. When <em>‘Xebia India IT Architects’ incorporated in 2006</em> there were only four people to start with, which gradually increased to 7 in next six months and then to 12 within an year. Xebia established their first office set up at Golf Course Road and then shifted to Millennium Plaza building which was in about 3000 sq.feet area, which could accommodate not more than fifteen people. We sometimes had to make few of our employee seated to our next door office to accommodate our clients coming in from abroad.</p>

<p>With time, we realized a need for larger work space which led us to move from 3000 sq.feet to 10,000 sq.feet of area in BPTP Park Centra Building, Sector 30 in Gurgaon. Our new office was inaugurated on 30th May, 2008 by The Dutch ambassador Bob Hiensch. This new office has a beautiful interior with a colorful cafeteria and cubical free workspace. As we started with little addition of infrastructure in our new office, we had only one LG plasma TV for distributed stand-ups. Now almost each development team has its own plasma TV for distributed stand ups. In the pursuit of kaizen, we are exploring to come up with another Xebia India Office.</p>

<p>This continuous improvement process was followed not only to improve the organizational bandwidth but it was also followed in <strong><em>Human Resource Department</em></strong> to <strong><em>hire the right human capital with right skills and attitude</em></strong>. In the beginning, only one person was taking care of the complete HR and Administration department, where as of now it is being taken care by a team of five people.</p>

<p>As we all know success comes with time; it took almost two and a half year to start with a sales division at Xebia India office in June 2009. We have a team of young and dynamic people who are dedicatedly working towards achievement of sales and marketing goals of the organization. Similarly, we also feel proud that we have an internal testing unit made up of very enthusiastic people.</p>

<p>This process has brought significant benefits in terms of <strong><em>competency, branding and growth</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I am proud to say that we are a happy family of more than 50 people and we may double by end of this year, still it is a continuous process by which everybody in the organization is always looking for ways to remove waste, impediment and improve quality and productivity to achieve our mission ‘Authority’.</p>

<p>By the way, Kaizen is a Japanese word which means Continuous Improvement :-)</p>
