              <h4>Reading time about 7  minutes</h4>

              <h1>Thinking Sideways</h1>

<p>&quot;I just had an idea…and its crap…&quot;</p>

<p>How many times have you just had a bulb light up over your head? Or, how many sleepless nights have you spent turning over &amp; over, hoping to see a tiny glimpse of the spark that signals the arrival of a new idea?</p>

<p>Your idea may have the potential to be bigger than Facebook, or maybe it just allows you to shave 2 minutes off your unit schedule. 2 minutes might not mean a lot to you, but it would definitely appeal to Foxconn employees. The size of the idea is not the only factor that drives creativity, but how much value that idea derives also matters.</p>

<p>I recently attended Edward de Bono’s creativity thinking workshop. The gathering was quite eclectic, ranging from engineers from one of the biggest heavy goods engineering companies, to sales managers from a cigarettes company, to education providers, and even a corporate lawyer.</p>

<p>If I could sum up the workshop in one sentence, it would be this: The mind can be trained to think creatively, to ‘ideate’. Of course, some will always be more talented than the rest at being creative, but it is not the prerogative of a select few. More often than not, it involves changing perceptions, and challenging established notions.</p>

<p>People are generally educated to think vertically, to go from one logical step to another, thus arriving at a solution to a stated problem. Vertical thinking often follows a linear approach, excluding alternate or remote possibilities, by keeping the problem in its target sights. Lateral Thinking approaches the problem from a different angle, by identifying &amp; exploring other possibilities, and also looks beyond the solution to the stated problem, to generate new concepts and explore new ways of doing things.</p>

<p>Lateral Thinking understands that our brains are pattern recognition systems. We can recognize objects &amp; situations very quickly. There are techniques that help us break this conditioned, patterned way of thinking. They provide a deliberate, systematic process to be creative, so that it works for you when you need it.</p>

<p><strong>Lateral Thinking Tools</strong></p>

<p>Tools can help you ideate. A tool is just a means to achieving an end, helps us in amplifying our skills and enables us to do things faster, or simpler. An example, a key aids us to escape a locked room, but it does not determine where we go from there.</p>

<p>Some of the Lateral Thinking tools we studied at the workshop were: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Alternatives / Concept Extraction:</em></strong> Use concepts to breed new ideas</li>
<li><strong><em>Focus:</em></strong> Sharpen or change your focus to improve your creative efforts</li>
<li><strong><em>Challenge:</em></strong> Break free from the limits of accepted ways of operating</li>
<li><strong><em>Random Entry:</em></strong> Use unconnected input to open new lines of thinking</li>
<li><strong><em>Provocation:</em></strong> Move from a provocative statement to useful ideas
<strong><em>Alternatives/Concept Extraction</em></strong> Concepts are a general way of doing things. A concept has to be put into implementation through a specific idea. Sometimes, when you are stuck at a particular problem, you might just consider taking a step back to get a broader perspective. Re-word the problem in general terms. From this, look for alternative solutions, which might not be related to the problem at hand. Use the newly generated ideas to further mine for concepts. Each new concept then provides a whole new pathway for generating new ideas. Expand &amp; redefine the problem until a useable solution can be generated and implemented.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a useful technique for widening the search for solutions when obvious approaches have been exhausted.</p>

<p><strong><em>Focus</em></strong> Focus sharpens or changes your perspective to improve the creative efforts. You learn to focus on areas no one else has thought about. By concentrating your focus to an area, you can up with a breakthrough idea simply by being the first person to be “at the scene of the crime”. Willing yourself to include focus on areas other than problem areas expands your chances of coming up with ideas.</p>

<p><strong><em>Challenge</em></strong> Challenge helps you to break from the current limits of accepted ways of thinking. It works on the simple premise of challenging the status quo, and is based on the assumption that there might be a better way of doing something, even though there is no problem the way the current system works.</p>

<p>It works by asking “Why?” in a non threatening way, more like an inquisitive query: Why something exists, why is it done the way it is? The result is a clearer understanding of the system, which then leads to fresh new ideas.</p>

<p>A simple example we tried our hand at the workshop: “Why are the tea cups &amp; saucers round?“</p>

<p>Some of the answers were: </p>

<ul>
<li>The round shape is symmetrical</li>
<li>Both left &amp; right handed people can hold the handle in either hand, and drink easily</li>
<li>People use the saucer to keep cookies and more…
Newer ideas that then sprang from this exercise were: </li>
<li>Would a hexagonal shape look more chic?</li>
<li>Would insulation on the outer shell of the cup allow the cup makers to discard the handle?</li>
<li>Can we extend the cup itself to have a hollow space below it to keep a couple of cookies, eliminating the need for the saucer?
<strong><em>Random Word</em></strong> The Random Word tool uses a random word or picture to open new lines of thinking. It relies on the human mind to find connections between seemingly unrelated things. It is a technique to link patterns associated with that word or picture with the patterns we are currently using with the problem at hand. This is a very effective tool, often providing startling leaps in creativity, even with untrained groups. The best words to use are concrete nouns. Care should be noted that they do not come from the same field as the problem under consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eg. You are considering the problem of reducing car pollution. The chosen random word is “plants”. Brainstorming on this could bring the following ideas: </p>

<ul>
<li>Plant trees on the roadside to convert CO2 to oxygen.</li>
<li>Pass exhaust gases through a soup of algae to convert CO2 to oxygen. An idea for a radical version of a catalytic converter, perhaps?</li>
<li>Plant also means a factory. Maybe gases could be collected and compressed, and offloaded while fuel is being filled. The collected gases would then be processed in a special plant to be cleaned?
<strong><em>Provocation</em></strong> Provocation technique works on the premise of postulating deliberate unreasonable ideas, which would ordinarily be vetoed off at face value. However, these ideas are laid out to change perception. These statements then serve as a springboard through which other practical ideas can be extracted. Unfortunately, it was nearing the end of the day. We didn’t get a chance to try this tool out at the workshop, and had to be content with a celebrated example of the application of this tool. Dr. Bono was once given a topic as an exercise that there were too few police officers to patrol the streets. He postulated that “The police have six eyes.” This outrageous statement, on further brainstorming, brought about the idea that citizens could serve as extra eyes to notice and report any unusual activities in their neighborhoods. This idea eventually grew into the Neighborhood Watch Program, now used widely in many cities across the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>People can either have the drive to use the tools to be creative. Or they might try out the tools, and on finding them quite useful, be motivated to be more creative. For example, the idea of dashboards and corporate wikis challenged and turned the traditional model of top down project management model on its head, while fostering collaboration &amp; team spirit.</p>
