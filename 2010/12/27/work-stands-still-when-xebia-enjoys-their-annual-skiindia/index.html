                    <h1>Work stands still...when Xebia enjoys their annual &quot;Skiindia&quot;</h1>

<p>For these few days in a year everything comes to a standstill at Xebia. No standup, no planning meeting, no retro, people just wish to make the most out of these three days. It was Wednesday, Dec 8th and we were working usual but there was a flavor of excitement and anticipation in the air. We were all looking forward to our much awaited annual trip. Our memories of the last year trip were still alive and we were all set to put them a step back in our mind and make space for the new ones. This time we were looking forward to capturing the  beautiy of the mountains. We were set to move to “Kanatal”, a picture perfect location amidst the tall mountain range. <img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DSC03431-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="Xebia Family"></p>

<p>The most enthusiastically awaited event of Xebia took us all by storm once again. <strong>Dec 9, 10 &amp; 11 left us mesmerized</strong> and asking for more as usual. Two of our French colleagues joined us for the trip. They seemed to more excited than us as it was their very first encounter with real India. <strong>The fun started right when we boarded the train.</strong> Though it was midnight, but it seemed as if we have just started our day.  Dumb-Charades topped the favoured list of all. With sleep in our eyes, we got down at Dehradun and started our 3 days journey to Kanatal. The view outside was abslutely stunning. Beautiful and raw. Billboards of Kanatal Resort &amp; Spa on the way were pumping all the excitement in. After the rollercoaster ride in the buses with people feeling motion sickness and trying to hold on till we reach our destination, we could see the other side of the personalities already. We were all bond eternally to a common goal……. The goal that we all will enjoy and have fun irrespective of the challenges posed by the coiled journey into the mountains and FUN is what we all were committed to!! Almost in an hour we reached the most awaited <strong>Kanatal Resort</strong>, a five star facility amidst the nature. Nothing more one can ask for. After warm welcome by hotel staff, we headed to our respective rooms. Afternoon was scheduled for a** trip to Dhanaulti<strong>,a 20 mins drive from Kanatal. Coaches started after exotic lunch and we reached the bio park of Dhanaulti . Trekking and finding our way together to the top was a great  feeling. Looking at the people giving hand of help to each other and looking after for each other was depicting the true Xebia culture. Some of us visited **the famous Surkanda Devi Temple</strong> and for some of us it was a real health check. The spot is located on a hill and one reaches there after a steep 1.5 km trek. Make sure that next time if you plan to visit this place, travel during daylight. With a <strong>predefined itinerary for all the three days</strong>, people had planned their hot water bath at swimming pool, Spa, Steam bath &amp; Sona Bath. Forgetting the daily chores, people were having fun playing Fuss ball, badminton, Video games,Basket ball and lot other activities. The evening was all decked up for the much awaited <strong>DJ Theme Night</strong>.  <img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/DSCN14741-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="MEOW moment of the DJ Night">With everybody in Red and Black attire and hiding behind their Eye Masks, it was fun to get hold of their partners for the Paper Dance , which also happened to be top-pick of the day. Amused to see our European colleagues dancing the Indian way and still wanting for more, we all went to bed waiting for another day to start. Unexpectedly, all ready on time, we met on breakfast table and soon left for scheduled <strong>rock climbing and rappelling</strong>. <img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_1238-300x168.jpg" alt="" title="On Top of the WORLD!!">Excited about it, some waited for their turn while other went trekking ahead to explore the nature beauty. Mountains, farms and fields… we all came back to resort where, the hot lunch was served in middle of Jungle. To our surprise, last day’s DJ success paved way for today’s DJ program. All decked up in our best with unlimited cocktails and snacks, we enjoyed till midnight. People who appeared to be reserved in office, came out to be a real surprise. Some dance performances were a real pick of the day kind of items, people whom we couldn’t imagine to shake a leg were break dancing!! Already feeling sad, we got up Saturday morning, still wanting to stay more. <strong>Mussoorie was the destination</strong> now. With all the fun during the way, we reached Mussoorie and were all set for our shopping spree followed by exotic lunch at hotel. Trip ended at New Delhi station at mid night. Ski India gives all of us a chance to come out from our shells, to charge our batteries and to unwind &amp; unfold ourselves to feel more connected with each other and ready for the all the hard work ahead. Everyone looks forward for such trip every year. Already looking forward for our Ski India 2011. GO TEAM! </p>
