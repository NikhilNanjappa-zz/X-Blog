                    <h1>Getting my Rooted Samsung Galaxy Note Back in Warranty</h1>

<p><strong>Getting my Rooted Samsung Galaxy Note Back in Warranty</strong></p>

<p>****Many people who root their Android Phones seldom realise that rooting is prohibited under the warranty policies of all smartphone manufacturers.  So the Moment your phone is rooted, its warranty becomes null and void. Now this may be a huge problem in case you need to resell it or get your rooted phone repaired under warranty .I recently ended up damaging the display of my Samsung Galaxy Note (GT N7000). Though my Phone was with in warranty period but I had rooted my phone and it was having a custom OS. To claim warranty I did the risky and complicated Unrooting on my Phone. After unrooting I landed up at a Samsung Service Center claiming free Repair under warranty.  Within minutes I got a shock when I was told that warranty of my phone had become void since I had rooted my phone and I will need to pay full chargers for repair and replacement of display.  I was extremely disappointed and frustrated by this demand of Service Center that warranty was void. Since a custom OS or Unrooting has got nothing to do with the display screen and moreover I had unrooted my phone before going to service center, which should not have left any trace of custom OS. I decided to question the  Service center&#39;s claim of custom OS being installed on my phones as I thought they may have seen some super user application being lying on my unrooted machine and assumed that I had rooted my phone in past.</p>

<p>But the answer and proof I was shown by service center guys  was something really new and different. I was shown a Custom Binary counter on my phone, which is always zero for a phone which has never been rooted. And increases itself by 1 every time a custom OS is installed on any Samsung Galaxy Phone.</p>

<p>Anyways I came back  and read articles and blogs  about custom binary counter, found several possible solutions to reset it but almost all of them mentioned a clear  risk of phone ended up being bricked(Useless like a stone).  After discussing in several communities and forums I found a possible risk free solution when I tried. It worked well. I could unroot my phone and even flash and reset the custom OS counter to 0.</p>

<p>So How to Unroot your Galaxy Phones? This is little complicated and messy but simple in execution once you have download correct ROM. Do make sure that you have at least 50% Battery before you start unrooting your phone and also do not disconnect or force switch off your phone under any circumstances. It may result in phone getting bricked. So here is the method to unroot the phone</p>

<p><strong>Resetting Custom OS counter to ZERO before Unrooting:</strong></p>

<p>Before unrooting you need to download an app called Triangle Away.  Mind you, Triangle away again would work only if device is rooted. So you need to reset the counter before Unrooting and not after it. Triangle away free version is not available on Android app store. It’s available only on XDA developer’s forum. Once can get it from there free. You can also download a paid version from Android app store if you don’t mind paying its developer a small amount.</p>

<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_16422&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;448&quot;]<img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screenshot_2013-03-25-15-14-09.png" alt="Resetting Binary Counter " title="Resetting Binary Counter "> Resetting Binary Counter[/caption]</p>

<p>Triangle away does two things.</p>

<p>a)      It can get you rid of that &quot;horrid yellow triangle&quot; we see every time a Rooted Phone boots up</p>

<p>b)      It can flash and reset custom binary counter to 0.</p>

<p>Now once you have installed Triangle away. Assign Root permissions to it. Once permissions are granted it will download an internal add on. After that you can simply press Reset Binary Counter, It will then boot the phone in download mode and give you the option to reset binary counter. Once reset it will boot the phone again in normal mode</p>

<p>Now the Custom Binary Counter is RESET to 0 and we are good to begin Unrooting.</p>

<p><strong>Unrooting a Samsung Galaxy Note:</strong></p>

<p>Step 1: Boot Your Galaxy Note in the download mode by pressing the Volume Down, Center button, and the Power button together for 10 seconds.</p>

<p>Step 2:  When you see the Yellow warning Triangle, press Volume Up button.</p>

<p>Step 3: Now connect your phone with your Laptop using USB Cable.</p>

<p>Step 4: Download stock ROM for the Indian Galaxy Notes Link for India ROM for ICS (4.X.X) (<a href="http://www.hotfile.com/dl/180494711/f61ca91/N7000DDLRB_N7000ODDLR4_INU.zip.htm">http://www.hotfile.com/dl/180494711/f61ca91/N7000DDLRB_N7000ODDLR4_INU.zip.htm</a>l)In case you bought the phone from other country or asked your friend Visiting US to get it cheap for you. Face the mess and hunt for the appropriate Stock ROM for that country on Internet.</p>

<p>Step 5: Unzip the Stock ROM</p>

<p>Step 6: Run ODIN, It can be downloaded here (<a href="http://stockroms.net/file/Tools/ODIN/Odin3v185.zip">http://stockroms.net/file/Tools/ODIN/Odin3v185.zip</a>)</p>

<p>Step 7: Choose “PDA” and choose the unzipped stock ROM file</p>

<p>Step 8:  Make sure you get a yellow highlighted COM on ODIN</p>

<p>Step 9: Press Start Now</p>

<p>Step 10: The Rooting will complete and your phone will be automatically restarted</p>

<p>Now Your Galaxy phone is back with original Samsung OS and is eligible for any Legal Warranty. You can now claim any free repairs on it in a Samsung y service Center. I got it too after doing this. Cheeers.</p>
