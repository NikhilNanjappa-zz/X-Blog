                    <h1>Design Thinking and Agile Software Development</h1>

<p><strong>Design Thinking for Software Development</strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Thinking like a designer can transform the way you develop products, services, processes – and even strategies. – Tim Brown</strong></p>

<p>After getting high on Design Thinking knowledge @ Agile NCR 2013 , I decided to dive a little further into this to, of course, acquire the knowledge and perspective.</p>

<p>But first, let us understand what makes design thinking important.</p>

<p>Problems affecting businesses are as complex as ever.  Overcoming these problems required comprehensive solutions based on dynamic innovation and big thinking.. And the valuable innovation can only be achieved by the combination of in-detail knowledge and direct observation of what customer/end user need and what their likes and dislikes are. No wonder, as a result of customer orientation, the need of satisfying customer needs and expectations and to have a competitive advantage, companies are innovating new ideas rather than creating new wrappers around older ones.<a href="/Users/a/Desktop/Design_Thinking_&amp;amp;_Software_Development_1.docx#_msocom_1"> </a></p>

<p><strong>Design thinking</strong> refers to the methods and processes for investigating ill-defined problems, acquiring information, analyzing knowledge, and positing solutions in the design and planning fields. Design thinking is one of the ways (and one of the oldest un-named practice) to solve severely complex problems that arise out of the user needs and rational.</p>

<p>And as per Tim Brown (CEO, IDEO), “It is a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and methods to match people’s need with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity”.</p>

<p>Design thinking is based on the tridents of Inspiration, Ideation and Implementation, further defined as Collating the <strong>emotion</strong> about the context of the problem (inspiration), <strong>Creativity</strong> for looking into the problem from different angles (ideation) and <strong>Rationality</strong> to analyze and fit solutions to the context (implementation).</p>

<p>Design thinking ( referenced as DT hereafter) differs from the conventional analytical approach to problem solving, as the basis for DT is human experience and perception whilst the latter was based primarily on number crunching DT employs various techniques like convergent and divergent thinking to reach or formulate a creative approach towards building up of ideas. This often involves human centered design methodology which will later create a small creative process to inspire relatively higher positive impact.</p>

<p><img src="http://xebee.xebia.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dESIGN-THINKING-300x240.png" alt="dESIGN THINKING"></p>

<p>[An innovation in its true sense is a combination of “what is desirable”, “how does it fall in the business vision”, and “how much is it technically feasible to create”.]</p>

<p>A DT process can be split in typical 7 phase</p>

<p>_Define – _Decide what issue you are trying to resolve and clearly identify the actors/Users. Lay the definition for what makes this workshop successful and prioritize the necessities.</p>

<p><em>Research – Dive into the problem taking historic accounts, thought leader’s opinion and conduct stakeholders’ interview. Try to collect as much information from all thinkable view angles.</em></p>

<p><em>Ideation – Identify the requirements and wish-list of your customers/users and generate as many ideas as you can for fulfilling it. Ideas originated here are just logged and are not judged upon or debated.</em></p>

<p><em>Prototype- Create drafts/working prototypes by combining, expanding and refining ideas. Here, you must present some selected ideas that brings more value to the table though you should maintain neutrality to the ideas.</em></p>

<p><em>Choose – Here, you review the objective and choose the solution/idea that is a best fit and gets you maximum value.</em></p>

<p>_Implement – You have now chosen an idea and now it is the time to formalize it. You make epics, stories and tasks. You plan these, put into backlog and assign resources to it. _</p>

<p><em>Learn – here you take feedback from the customer about the implementation and do a retrospective about the process. You measure success and adapt the processes for further improvements</em></p>

<p>Though there is no particular order to organize these phases, they must be arranged in which the design thinker feels it would add maximum value.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>This process is adapted in software development in following way: </p>

<ol>
<li>Understand(Define and Research) : Don’t jump to conclusions or right solution upfront. If required, backtrack from what seems to be the right solution and understand different perspectives. What may seem obvious or correct to you as a developer might not be high on the priority or the wants list for the end user.</li>
<li>Ideate: Brainstorm all possible alternatives, defer judgment and prejudice. Jeff Pattson recommends a little exercise for a teaser: “Try this quick exercise: Pull out a piece of paper and a pen. In the upper left corner, draw a smiley face. Now, draw twenty additional, unique faces. Try to come up with the most fun, simple face you can. If you&#39;re having trouble coming up with faces, think of professions like doctor or pirate or animals like tigers or pigs.” . Ironic but true, that your first idea may never be the best idea.</li>
<li>Iterate (Prototype): Combine your best ideas and formulate paper or working prototypes. Iterate over each combination and test the ideas against all the requirements and prophecies<a href="/Users/a/Desktop/Design_Thinking_&amp;amp;_Software_Development_1.docx#_msocom_4">[M4]</a>  or establishments that you formulated while Understanding the problem. Here you should iterate and incrementally evolve the design.</li>
<li>Plan &amp; Execute (Choose and Implement): The process of refining your idea for a prototype would lead to a close approximation of the possible solution, which addresses a large part of the key requirements. A Perato approach of 80:20, with all the key fundamental requirements and 80% of the other requirements being addressed, could be followed. By now, you will have clarity on what features you want to develop. From here you can fork out epics and slice put the stories and tasks. Needless to say, that you will need to continually validate and improve on the solution.</li>
<li>Demo &amp; Retrospective : Here you take a regular feedback from the business owner or stakeholders by formulating regular feedback cycles ( sprints/iteration in agile). After demo, you do a retrospective to evaluate “what are we doing right”, “what can be improved” and “what should we stop doing”. By categorizing these items, you can have more focus on improving on the things and proceed in the right direction.</li>
</ol>
